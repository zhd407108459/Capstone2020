This packages demo sence have 4 weapon Type.
You can use num [2,3,4,5] to select the weapon Type
And keypad [A,D] to change the weapon
And also can chage speed of the particles/projectiles by keypad [Z,X]

There was two ways of how I use to made the particles move
1. Adding a rigidbody force by spripting in Particle spawner.
2. Use the velosity component of particles system.

Some of them have light attached.
You can feel free to edit the texture and materials I made it to be easily edit.
